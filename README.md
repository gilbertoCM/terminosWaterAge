# This repository contains the climatological year of temperature and salinity variation throughout 2016-2018. 
-	Conductivity_microsiemens_cm
-	Temp_C

The data were measured every 30 minutes using Onset U24-001 Conductivity Data Logger sensors (HOBO) in the Ciudad del Carmen Observatory 1, measured in the Carmen Coastal Observatory (18°37'54.04"N, 91°49'55.15"W), in Marina Port of the Ciudad del Carmen, Campeche[^1].  

I calculated the salinity using Python implementation of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 1, assuming a constant sea level pressure = 0. 
Furthermore, the repository has model simulation temperature and salinity results of a 3D hydrodynamic model, which was implemented in the Ecological Modelling Laboratory, Ciudad del Carmen, ICML, UNAM, using the Delft3D 4.01.00[^2]. 


**Warning** 2016 is used as a year reference.
